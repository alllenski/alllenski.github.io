            Jones is a platformer game we made using a level editor for a level design class. The level editor came with prebuilt tilesets
            but we decided to create an original tileset and character to better represent the mood and story. The project was a pair work and 
            both of us did designed the levels and because we already were using a level editor, no programming (only some for events) was needed.

            The theme we were aiming for was a treasure hunter in an ancient temple, like Indiana Jones.

            This project was actually a remake of another school project 2 years back, for our first game project in college. The project was also named
            Jones and featured a deadly temple, treasure and the titular character, Jones.
