            <p>Made in 48 hours for Global Game Jam 2021 "Lost and Found"</p>
            <p>
            Founders Keepers is a "Paper's Please" style of game, where you have to play as the person behind a lost and found desk.
            The player has to manage documents keep found objects and return them to their rightful owners whilst sorting out lots of paperwork.
            I was part of a team of four and I was the lead programmer.

            <p class="caption">So many documents and items!</p>
            <p>
            This was our teams' first jam and we definitely worked extremely hard for the duration of the jam. We are very satisfied with the end results
            although personally as the programmer I could say that towards the end my code became super messy.
