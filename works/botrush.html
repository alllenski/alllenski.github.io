            Botrush is arcade style survive-as-long-as-you-can type of game. The main mechanic and interpretation of the theme was that the doctor
            and the robot were "joined together" but also separately served different purposes like attacking or picking up scrap. I was part of a team of three
            and I did most of the programming and some UI art.

            The game didn't get that too hot of a reception due to the game being barely complete (if at all complete.) The team also had to manage priorities
            with schoolworks and that helped slow down development, but I still think we made good progress and a good effort.
